title:Introduction â€” first foray

Maybe the first thing I should explain is why now? I've been writing software
professionally for over 25 years. I've not previously contemplated writing my
own blog. In fact, I would previously have considered writing a blog
self-indulgent and a sign that the writer is more concerned with self-promotion
than with writing software. So many blogs are a quick skim of a technology
that seems more about ticking boxes (today's blog done!) than with actually
being informative or useful. And for good reason: it takes a lot of time to
write a good blog entry; something I am unlikely to find much of myself. So, why
now?

Primarily, I want to do two things. Firstly, I want to learn more modern
technology. It's been easy to rely on what I've picked up over the last 25
years. When I was younger, I was much keener on spending my own time learning
new technologies than I am now. I want to rekindle some of that enthusiasm,
and I think that writing a blog will help with that. Secondly, I want to help
embed what I'm learning by writing about it.

It's pretty horrible to admit that when my teachers were getting us to copy
textbooks into our exercise books, which seemed such a pointless and boring
task at the time, they actually had a point. Writing things helps memory; but
rewriting things in your own words works even better.

So, this blog is, essentially, solipsistically, for me.
