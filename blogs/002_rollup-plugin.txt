title: A Rollup Plugin
published-date:2023-01-20

## Some notes:

To install the plugin from the filesystem:
```bash
npm i  rollup-plugin/ --save-dev
```

This creates a link to the where the plugin is on the filesystem, so no need
to re-install when I make changes to the plugin.

Hm. Maybe I need to write a rollup application with plugins to support Vue?
